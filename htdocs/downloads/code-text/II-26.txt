provide for the
optional transfer to such pension system of any officer or employee of either
the Department of

such exceptions,
conditions, restrictions and classifications as may be provided by ordinance;
provided, however,
  (1)that upon the adoption of an ordinance providing for their participation in
such pension
system, eligible officers and employees of the Department of Aviation, of the
Police
Department and of the Fire Department who do not elect to participate in such
pension
system, shall be entitled to the pensions, retirement benefits, other benefits
or allowances for
themselves, their widows or dependents, under the laws or ordinances in force
immediately
prior to the adoption of such ordinance;
  (2)nothing in this subsection shall operate or be construed to diminish in any
way the rights of
any eligible members of the Police Department or of the Fire Department who are
not
participants in the presently existing general pension system of the City of
Baltimore, their
widows or dependents, to pensions, retirement benefits, other benefits or
allowances provided
for by laws or ordinances in force as of January 1, 1926.
Until amended by ordinance, the presently existing pension and retirement
systems of the City shall
remain in force.  The provisions of this subsection shall be deemed to be in
addition to and not in
substitution of any other powers or authorizations now conferred upon the Mayor
and City Council
of Baltimore.
