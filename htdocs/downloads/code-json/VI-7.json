If the carrying out of a\nparticular program, purpose, activity, or project depends upon action by a body other than the\nCity, the City Council may insert a specific provision in the proposed Ordinance of Estimates\nmaking the appropriation for the particular program, purpose, activity or project contingent upon\nsuch action.\n\n (c)  Revenue ordinances.\n\nAs soon as practicable after the passage of the Ordinance of Estimates, the City Council shall\nenact such revenue ordinances as are necessary to produce sufficient expected revenues, as\nestimated by the Board of Estimates, to cover the total anticipated expenditures authorized by the\nOrdinance of Estimates.  The Council may adopt revenue sources or revenue rates other than\nthose proposed by the Board and in each such instance the estimate of the revenue to be yielded\nby such a source or rate shall be made by the Board of Estimates.\n\nThe Board of Estimates shall, taking into account any reductions and eliminations made by the\nCity Council in the anticipated expenditures contained in the proposed Ordinance of Estimates\nand the revenues to be derived from all existing sources and from any new sources or new rates\nenacted by the City Council, certify to the Council the difference between the anticipated\nexpenditures for the next fiscal year contained in the Ordinance of Estimates and all expected\nrevenues other than from the full rate property tax.  The Board shall then state a rate for the levy\nof full rate property taxes sufficient to realize the amount required to meet the said difference and\nthe ordinance making the annual levy of full rate property taxes shall fix a rate not less than that\nstated by the Board so that it shall not be necessary at any time for the City to create a floating\ndebt to meet any deficiency, and it shall not
