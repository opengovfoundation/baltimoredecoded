But nothing in this Charter relating\nto the Civil Service forbids the discharge, reduction in pay or position, or suspension of an\nofficer or employee for any just cause.\n\n  (2)Whenever a non-probationary employee is discharged, reduced in pay or position, or\nsuspended for more than 30 days, the appointing officer shall furnish a copy of the order of\ndischarge, reduction, or suspension, together with a statement of the reasons for the action, to\nthe employee and to the Commission.\n\n  (3)The employee may contest the action by:\n\n    (i)requesting a hearing before the Commission; or\n\n    (ii)initiating a grievance pursuant to an applicable grievance and arbitration procedure, if\nany, contained in an applicable collective bargaining agreement.\n\n  (4)Once an employee has chosen to contest an action by electing one of the procedures specified\nin paragraph (3) of this subsection, the employee is bound by that election and may not\nsubsequently choose to follow a different procedure.\n\n(5)In all cases, except one in which an employee elects to contest an action through a grievance\nand arbitration procedure under paragraph (3)(ii) of this subsection, the Commission may,\nand on the written request of the employee, the Commission shall investigate the disciplinary\naction.

Persons so discharged shall have\npreference in the order of their seniority over others on the eligible list, subject, however, to the\nterms of the next subsection and to any priority to which any person may be entitled by virtue of\nany preference to veterans or their dependents.\n\n (c)  Reductions in force \u2014 seasonal and part-time employees.\n\nIn the case of classes of seasonal or
